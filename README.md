# 🍦 Capstone Flask

🐍🗃️ A simulation-driven ice cream flavor purchase prediction and analysis system built with Flask and SQLite.

## ✨ Features

- 💾 **Database Setup**  
  Initializes SQLite tables for users, purchases, flavor counts, simulation types, truck reports, total purchases, simulation references, and feedback messages.

- 🎲 **Customer Simulations**  
  Multiple classes simulate customer flavor choices with seasonal and probabilistic variations (Winter ❄️, Summer ☀️, Normal variants with different times and probabilities).

- 📊 **Data Persistence**  
  Functions to save simulation data, flavor counts, truck reports, total purchases, and user feedback to the database with conflict resolution.

- 📈 **Visualization**  
  Generates bar charts of total flavor purchases from simulation results and saves them as static images.

- 🔐 **User Authentication**  
  Implements login and registration functionality with session management.

- 🛣️ **Templating and Routing**  
  Uses Jinja2 templating engine and Flask Blueprints for modular routing including dynamic URL handling.

## 🚀 Advanced Features

- 📊 **Charts**  
  (Matplotlib) Various charts for winter, summer, normal conditions, and general analytics such as average purchases, truck orders, and purchases over time.

- 🤖 **AI Scripts**  
  (Ski-Kit-Learn) Machine learning models for predicting flavor purchases and truck orders.
